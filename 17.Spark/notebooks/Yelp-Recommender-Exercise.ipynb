    "\n",
    "You will use the data from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.de/dataset_challenge), which contains information about businesses, users, reviews and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will need to focus only on the following files:\n",
    "- yelp_academic_dataset_business.json\n",
    "- yelp_academic_dataset_review.json\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build a recommender using [Spark's ALS (Alternating Least Squares)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html) and then generate recommendations for a given user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset is quite big, you should pick a business category (e.g. Restaurants) and a city (e.g. Edinburgh) and work on the recommender using only this subset of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please take some time to:\n",
    "- find out what information you will need to feed as input to Spark's ALS\n",
    "- check how this information is available in the dataset\n",
    "- plan how you will tackle this problem"
